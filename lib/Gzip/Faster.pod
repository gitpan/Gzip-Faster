=head1 NAME

Gzip::Faster - gzip and gunzip, without the fuss

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Gzip::Faster;
    my $gzipped = gzip ($input);
    my $roundtrip = gunzip ($gzipped);
    # $roundtrip is the same as $input

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module compresses to and decompresses from the gzip format.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 gzip

    my $zipped = gzip ($stuff);

This compresses C<$stuff> into the gzip format. The return value is
the compressed version of C<$stuff>.

=head2 gunzip

    my $stuff = gunzip ($zipped);

This uncompresses C<$zipped> and returns the result of the
uncompression. It returns the undefined value if C<$zipped> is the
undefined value or an empty string. Otherwise, it throws a fatal error
if C<$zipped> is not in the gzip format.

=head2 gzip_file

    my $zipped = gzip_file ('file');

This reads the contents of F<file> into memory and then runs L</gzip>
on the file's contents. The return value and the possible errors are
the same as L</gzip>, plus this may also throw an error if C<open>
fails.

=head2 gunzip_file

    my $stuff = gunzip_file ('file.gz');

This reads the contents of F<file.gz> into memory and then runs
L</gunzip> on the file's contents. The return value and the possible
errors are the same as L</gunzip>, plus this may also throw an error
if C<open> fails.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

This section compares the performance of Gzip::Faster with
L<IO::Compress::Gzip> and L<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip>. According to my
results, Gzip::Faster is about five times faster to load, seven times
faster to compress, and twenty-five times faster to uncompress. Round
trips are about ten times faster with Gzip::Faster.

The versions used in this test are as follows:

    $IO::Compress::Gzip::VERSION = 2.060
    $IO::Uncompress::Gunzip::VERSION = 2.060
    $Gzip::Faster::VERSION = 0.07


Here is a comparison of load times:

    
                Rate Load IOUG Load IOCG   Load GF
    Load IOUG 25.1/s        --       -4%      -81%
    Load IOCG 26.2/s        4%        --      -80%
    Load GF    132/s      425%      403%        --


Here is a comparison of a round-trip:

    
                          Rate IO::Compress::Gzip       Gzip::Faster
    IO::Compress::Gzip  1268/s                 --               -90%
    Gzip::Faster       12623/s               896%                 --


Here is a comparison of gzip (compression) only:

    
                          Rate IO::Compress::Gzip       Gzip::Faster
    IO::Compress::Gzip  2490/s                 --               -86%
    Gzip::Faster       17680/s               610%                 --


Here is a comparison of gunzip (decompression) only:

    
                              Rate IO::Uncompress::Gunzip           Gzip::Faster
    IO::Uncompress::Gunzip  2722/s                     --                   -96%
    Gzip::Faster           67368/s                  2375%                     --


The test file is in "examples/benchmark.pl" in the distribution.

There is also a module called L<Compress::Raw::Zlib> which offers
access to zlib itself. It may offer improved performance, however I
have not figured out what it does yet. Its documented way of making a
gzip compressed object returns something I cannot understand so I was
unable to include it in the benchmark.

=head1 BUGS

The module source code includes disabled functionality to round-trip
Perl flags. I applied this to preserving Perl's "utf8" flag. However,
the mechanism I used trips a browser bug in the Firefox web browser
where it produces a content encoding error message. Thus this
functionality is disabled. Please refer to the file
F<gzip-faster-perl.c> in the distribution, the relevant parts are
commented out with a macro C<COPY_PERL>.
